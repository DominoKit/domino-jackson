/**
 * Marker annotation that indicates that the value of annotated accessor (either field or "getter"
 * method [a method with non-void return type, no args]) is to be used as the single value to
 * serialize for the instance, instead of the usual method of collecting properties of value.
 * Usually value will be of a simple scalar type (String or Number), but it can be any serializable
 * type (Collection, Map or Bean).
 *
 * <p>At most one accessor of a <code>Class</code> can be annotated with this annotation; if more
 * than one is found, an exception may be thrown. Also, if method signature of annotated method is
 * not compatible with Getters, an exception may be thrown (whether exception is thrown or not is an
 * implementation detail (due to filtering during introspection, some annotations may be skipped)
 * and applications should not rely on specific behavior).
 *
 * <p>A typical usage is that of annotating <code>toString()</code> method so that returned String
 * value is used as the JSON serialization; and if deserialization is needed, there is matching
 * constructor or factory method annotated with {@link JsonCreator} annotation.
 *
 * <p>Boolean argument is only used so that sub-classes can "disable" annotation if necessary.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: when use for Java <code>enum</code>s, one additional feature is that value returned by
 * annotated method is also considered to be the value to deserialize from, not just JSON String to
 * serialize as. This is possible since set of Enum values is constant and it is possible to define
 * mapping, but can not be done in general for POJO types; as such, this is not used for POJO
 * deserialization.
