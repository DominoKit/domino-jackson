 * Marker annotation that can be used to define a logical "any setter" mutator -- either using
 * non-static two-argument method (first argument name of property, second value to set) or a field
 * (of type {@link java.util.Map} or POJO) - to be used as a "fallback" handler for all otherwise
 * unrecognized properties found from JSON content. It is similar to {@link
 * javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAnyElement} in behavior; and can only be used to denote a single
 * property per type.
 *
 * <p>If used, all otherwise unmapped key-value pairs from JSON Object values are added using
 * mutator.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: ability to annotated fields was added in version 2.8; earlier only methods could be
 * annotated.
