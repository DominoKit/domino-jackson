/**
 * Annotation that can be used to define ordering (possibly partial) to use when serializing object
 * properties. Properties included in annotation declaration will be serialized first (in defined
 * order), followed by any properties not included in the definition. Annotation definition will
 * override any implicit orderings (such as guarantee that Creator-properties are serialized before
 * non-creator properties)
 *
 * <p>Examples:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  // ensure that "id" and "name" are output before other properties
 *  &#64;JsonPropertyOrder({ "id", "name" })
 *  // order any properties that don't have explicit setting using alphabetic order
 *  &#64;JsonPropertyOrder(alphabetic=true)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This annotation may or may not have effect on deserialization: for basic JSON handling there
 * is no effect, but for other supported data types (or structural conventions) there may be.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: annotation is allowed for properties, starting with 2.4, mostly to support alphabetic
 * ordering of {@link java.util.Map} entries.
