 * Optional Boolean value ("nullean"). Needed just because Java annotations can not take 'null' as a
 * value (even as default), so there is no way to distinguish between explicit `true` and `false`,
 * and lack of choice (related: annotations are limited to primitives, so {@link Boolean} not
 * allowed as solution).
 *
 * <p>Note: although use of `true` and `false` would be more convenient, they can not be chosen
 * since they are Java keyword and compiler won't allow the choice. And since enum naming convention
 * suggests all-upper-case, that is what is done here.
