/**
 * Annotation used for indicating that values of annotated type or property should be serializing so
 * that instances either contain additional object identifier (in addition actual object
 * properties), or as a reference that consists of an object id that refers to a full serialization.
 * In practice this is done by serializing the first instance as full object and object identity,
 * and other references to the object as reference values.
 *
 * <p>There are two main approaches to generating object identifier: either using a generator
 * (either one of standard ones, or a custom generator), or using a value of a property. The latter
 * case is indicated by using a placeholder generator marker {@link
 * ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator}; former by using explicit generator. Object id has to be
 * serialized as a property in case of POJOs; object identity is currently NOT support for JSON
 * Array types (Java arrays or Lists) or Java Map types.
 *
 * <p>Finally, note that generator type of {@link ObjectIdGenerators.None} indicates that no Object
 * Id should be included or used: it is included to allow suppressing Object Ids using mix-in
 * annotations.
